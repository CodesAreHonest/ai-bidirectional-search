Software Resources 
------------------
1. Window 10 Operating System
2. AllegroCL Express Edition 
3. SourceTree 
4. Git 

Features
--------
1. User can choose to implement search algorithms using **BFS** or **modified DFS**.  
2. Construction of search tree avoid repeated nodes with open and close list.  
3. User can select at most, two forbidden cities for **modified DFS** to prevent agent by pass the forbidden city.
4. User can choose to sort nodes at each level in ascending and descending order. 
5. The content of open and closed lists during tree traversal is updated. 
6. Solution path of selected algorithm is displayed.
7. Path cost of selected algorithm is displayed.
